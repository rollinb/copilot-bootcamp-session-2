# UI Guidelines

This document outlines the UI guidelines for the TODO application.

1. Material Design
   - Use Material design principles and components for layout, interaction, and visual language.
   - Prefer Material-ready component libraries or implement Material patterns for cards, lists, dialogs, and form controls.

2. Colors and Surfaces
   - Main page backgrounds: white.
   - Highlighting and subtle surfaces: light grey.
   - Primary actions and controls (buttons, primary links, active states): blue.

Notes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for accessibility when using blue and light grey on white.
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography consistent with Material guidelines.
- Use clear affordances for interactive elements (e.g., ripple on click, raised buttons for primary actions).
